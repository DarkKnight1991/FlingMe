# FlingMe
Simple game to fling a view, animate and catch it!
You can fling the circle manually and then try to catch it (in which case score won't be calculated) or you can click "start"
to let the application decide an animation path and speed for you. You can also set difficulty level. Score will be calculated
based on difficulty level, speed, time spent, catch attempts.
